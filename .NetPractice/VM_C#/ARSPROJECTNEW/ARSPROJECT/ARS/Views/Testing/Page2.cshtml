                More often than not, booking directly through the airline’s website will give you the best price.
                Another reason to book directly  through an airline’s website is to use  frequent flyer  miles
                — hooray for award flights!One of the things I love about this site is the super visual way they
                show you the price trends for your flight.

                you can tell if you could save some money by shifting around your travel dates a bit. They also
                offer a price tracker and lots of filtering options on the left-hand side of the screen.They also
                offer Mix and Match fares which are simply 2 one way tickets from different providers packaged
                together to get you the best deal. However, unlike other sites, to book these types of tickets
                you do have to go to 2 separate websites to book.
